            <h5>Technical skills</h5>
            <div class="img"  ><img src="/Images/Technical-Skills-for-Resume-Infographic.png" alt="Image of skills"></div>
            <p>If you will ask me I would suggest technical skills are the most important skillset for bagging an offer in dream company.No matter how good your other skills are be it in extra-curicular activities or you have above 9.5+ cgpa but if you don't have the desired technical skills company needs to have you aren't getting anywhere. I would suggest doing competitive programming from websites such as hackerrank, codechef etc to boost your coding as well as technical skills because all companies are going to conduct technical/coding round</p>

            <h2>COMMUNICATION SKILLS</h2>
            <div class="image" ><img src ="/Images/communication-skills-importance.jpg" alt=" " ></div>
            <p> Another important aspect of placement activity is communication skills. There are going to be groups discussion in a placement activity to test how good you are at expressing your views and how eloquent you are.Also at interview they are going to see how good you are at communicating because at the end of a day to get past an interview you need good communication skills to demonstrate you personality and technical skills</p>
